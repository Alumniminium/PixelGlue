Move System has to be threaded, also need a new seperate move system for the player only as async moving will cause slight lag and make the camera follow jerky.
Client/Server Sync rectangle isn't lining up, causes extreme slowdown when client destroys tons of entities and the server disagrees and respawns them
Networking has to be async.






No behavior in entities, helper methods are ok, no fields in systems, no methods in components.
World = 
    |> System[] =
        |> Behavior
    |> Component[]
        |> Data
    |> Dict<id,Entity>
        |> Entity =
            |> Id
            |> Component[]




EntityId and UniqueId are seperate. Need to have a lookup table to lookup which EntityId corresponds to which UniqueId on the server.
